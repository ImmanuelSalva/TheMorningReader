                    <h1>China is Cracking Down on The For-profit Private Tutoring Industry</h1>
                    <p>
                    In the interest of reducing costs for it's Citizens, the Chinese Communist Party 
                    (CCP) banned for-profit tutoring. Previously, parents solicited tutoring 
                    services throughout a childâ€™s primary and secondary education to prepare them 
                    for the National College Entrance Examination which determines whether a Chinese 
                    student is eligible for undergraduate education.

                       Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi. And After Researching This 
                       Event Through Other News Sites I Can Finally Report on This Without Having Any Wrongs.
