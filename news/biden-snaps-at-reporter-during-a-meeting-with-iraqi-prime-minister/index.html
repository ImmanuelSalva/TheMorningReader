            <h1>Biden Snaps at Reporter During a Meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister</h1>
            <p>
            So, I Read This All Over Conservative and Probably Some Progressive News Sites That Biden Snapped At a Reporter During a Meeting With Iraq's Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi. And After Researching This Event Through Other News Sites I Can Finally Report on This Without Having Any Wrongs.
                <br />
            The Reporter Asked: “Mr. President, Veterans Affairs is going to have a mandate for its healthcare–” Kelly O’Donnell, an NBC News Reporter, said before being cut off by Biden.
                <br />
            “You are such a pain in the neck, but I’m going to answer your question because we’ve known each other so long,” Biden said to The. “It has nothing to do with Iraq.”
                <br />
            “Yes, Veteran Affairs is going to, in fact, require that all doctors working in their facilities are gonna have to be vaccinated,” Biden added.
                <br />
            After The Incident CNN's Political Commentator Scott Jennings Tweeted: "Verbally abusive and dismissive of a female journalist. Keeps happening over and over. Why?".
